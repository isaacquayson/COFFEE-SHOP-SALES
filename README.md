Project Overview
Analyze historical coffee shop sales across multiple stores to identify:

1. Seasonal and daily trends

2. Top-performing items and peak hours

3. Potential opportunities for growth


Dataset Description
dataset contains:

a. Date / Time<br/>
b. Store ID<br/>
c. Product ID / Name<br/>
d. Units Sold<br/>
e.Price / Revenue<br/>

Methodology
Data Collection & Loading
Imported raw CSV files.

Combined datasets if multiple (e.g. daily/weekly)

Loaded into Excel (Power Query) or Python/R for exploratory analysis.

Data Cleaning
Handled missing values (e.g., filled, dropped, or flagged).

Standardized date formats and removed duplicates.

Validated numerical ranges (prices, quantities).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Computed total sales by store, product, date.

Identified average sale value (ASV) per transaction.

Examined temporal trends: dailyweek patterns, monthly peaks.<br/>

Visualization
Created charts in Excel:

Time series: daily/monthly revenue

Pivot charts: store-wise comparisons

Heatmaps: hourly vs. weekday sales

Applied filters and slicers for interactive dashboards.

Analysis in Excel
Pivot tables for summary stats.

Calculated key metrics:

Total revenue

Average basket size

Items per transaction

Applied conditional formatting for trend spotting.<br/>

Key Findings
Seasonality: Highest sales in Q4 (holiday period), lowest in Julyâ€“August.

Daily Trends: Peak at 9am and 3pm; weekends show ~20% lift.

Product Performance: Espresso & Lattes drive ~60% of revenue. Muffins perform well mid-morning.

Store Comparison: Store 3 outperformed others by ~15% in average transaction value.

Recommendations<br/>
Optimize staffing around 9am & 3pm peaks.

Promote high-margin items (esp. during slow periods).

Introduce combo deals (e.g. coffee + pastry discounts).

Extend weekend hours or promotions to further leverage demand.

Pilot seasonal drinks around Q4 to capitalize on holiday traffic.
